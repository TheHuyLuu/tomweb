<h2> Late Graduation </h2>
  <p>Just graduated 5 years studying at Hanoi Open University, at graphic design faculty, this made my studying time a total of 8 years! But well, let's just go with the flow.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Even though the experience I gained in terms of practicing graphic design in digital format I got from university was less than what I got from working on a real project, I had the chance to explore traditional art forms like ceramic sculpture, water marbling, woodcut,...</p>
  <br>
  <p>The most challenging course for me was my graduation project, for which I chose to redesign the visual identity of i3 JSC and its product packaging. Those first days were not that smooth, and I faced some obstacles that made me think I wasn‚Äôt going to make it. For weeks and weeks, I was swimming in deadlines, working late through the night and sweating my ass off to finish the packaging print files so we‚Äôd have time to fold everything. But in the end, my work was well received by my professors.</p>

<h2> Independent Tech </h2>
  <p>I just had my data deleted by a big storage service company without any warning‚Äîthat‚Äôs when I realized these companies can do whatever they want with our data. After that, I found myself more and more interested in the concept of tech independence‚Äîbuilding systems that don‚Äôt rely too heavily on big tech companies.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Creating a simple website with basic HTML and CSS turned out to be relaxing and even fun. I realized I don‚Äôt need anything too complex for a personal site‚Äîjust a basic understanding of HTML and CSS, and that‚Äôs enough. For me, learning how to host a server and do some basic web coding feels like the first step into the world of independent tech.</p>
  <br>
  <p>On top of that, I started using Linux on my mom‚Äôs old HP notebook. I chose Linux Mint because this was actually my second attempt with Linux (the first time was on my dad‚Äôs laptop when I was younger, trying to install games but failing to figure it out). Since then, my love for open-source projects has only grown. I also stopped using Spotify and YouTube Premium‚ÄîI now load my own songs onto an old iPhone SE (1st gen), keeping a personal music library that I fully own.</p>

  <h2> Working </h2>
  <p> Working part-time for ƒê√¨nh Collective and as a creative partner at i3 JSC has given me more breathing room for personal projects and learning on the side (like this website and exploring independent tech, I‚Äôm kinda nerdy after all ü§ì), although I still need 100% focus whenever a project is hitting its deadline.</p>
  <br>
  <p>I also just finished a small project for i3, which was to create a workspace on the first floor and redesign part of the front area. It was my first time working as an interior designer, and with Th·ªßy‚Äôs help, I picked up a lot about spatial design‚Äîthings like ergonomics, materials, execution, and so on.</p>
